# Daily-Planner-App

## Description

Created a simple daily planner to help the user schedule and manage their day effectively. Each time-block is colour-coded based on past, present, future according to the current time. The user is able to enter and save their tasks within the planner. The entered tasks are stored locally, ensuring the task persist even if the user refreshes the webpage. To create this planner, I used HTML, boostrap, CSS and JQuery.

## Usage
